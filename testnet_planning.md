# **Testnet Planning**

## **Disclaimer**

Everything is subject to change and as close as possible to the realities of testnets that take place in various projects, so at this stage you will learn many useful things in practice**.** Pay attention to the discord validator announcement channel for announcements. We are testing open source beta software. Expect something to break. If the documentation is not enough or you find some kind of bug, make a PR.

## **Overview**

- 3 Phases
- Governance proposals
    - Enable Transfers
- Rewards: `To keep the competitive process going, we see the validators with the most points and they will be rewarded`
- Schedule: `26.09.2022 - 16.10.2022`
- For the Genesis and Celebrate sections please sign a transaction for each of the tasks and provide the txHash in a PR.

## **Phase - 1: Start chain (max 30 points)**

- GenTx Validator Address Submission : `date and time wiil be refined for a specific course`. Up to `70% of the flow`  will be accepted.

 `25 Points = 25 000 atom for successful wallet submissions.`

- Network start time:  `30.09.2022 15:00 UTC`

`20 Points = 20 000 atom for set up post genesis validators.`

- Provide peer

`5 points =  5000 atom for everyone who provides a peer.`

---

## **Phase - 2: Governance (max 30 points)**

Lead validator team will create a governance proposal on `05.10.2022 15:00 UTC`, to update the transfer parameter. You will need to study the proposals, find the correct one and vote.

In order to find correct proposal you will need to run query command using your network client binary (`gaiad` in our case). Please issue following command `gaiad query gov proposals`, and find proposal with `title:` ‚ÄùVote for me friend‚Äù.

- Proposal: `Update true`
- Voting Period: `05.10.2022 15:00 UTC - 06.10.2022 23:00 UTC`
- Upgrade Height: `TBD`

**What should validators do?**

- Review the parameter change proposal and cast your vote before voting period endtime.

## **NOTE:**

Validator School is committed to building a strong community. Therefore, the testnet is built in such a way as to cover the most common tasks and situations that you will encounter as a validator.

In addition to this, in order to involve and encourage active members of the Validator School, those participants who score the most points will receive an additional delegation in the main network from DVS.

In addition to this, you will have passed the first testnet, which will be documented on github and twitter (provided that you complete all the testnet tasks) and this will give you a starting point in working with these services and simplify the development of your portfolio.
